--- NOTES/HONOR CODE ---

I used my fourth and final extension on this homework.

I affirm I have adhered to the Honor Code on this assignment. - Caeli Massey


--- PROGRAMS ---

list_tree.c -- contains funtions used to make and alter dtnode structures
	       (dtnodes can function as linked list AND binary tree nodes)

encode.c -- encode will read in a text file, encode its contents using huffman compression,
	    and print the encoded version to output.

decode.c -- decode will essentially undo files encoded by encode (it returns the original, uncoded version)


--- BUGS ---
No known Valgrind/memory allocation errors.

I was having segmentation faults on any large text files (pretty unfortunate, since those are the most
convenient to compress!!). It seemed to be happening in my getCodes() function. I increased the max length
of the code strings and this seemed to fix it for my text input, but I'm still confused on why it needed to
be bigger. It was originally 9 (i.e. codes could be up to 8 bits), and I don't see how a Huffman code could
exceed that and still be helpful since the original char is only 8 bits.

Anyway, I THINK I fixed it, but it may still be a problem, and I would love input on why it happened in the
first place if I'm missing something.

--- TIME SPENT ---
I honestly forgot to keep track of how much time this took me again, but it was a pretty long time. I'd say
6-7 hours minimum, including writing README's/man pages, etc. This was tricky!! (A neat assignment, though!)


--- FAREWELLS ---
Happy Holidays to whoever's grading this, and I hope you have a wonderful Winter break!!! :)
